# CS465_Full_Stack
Architecture
In my full stack project, I used various frontend development techniques, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and single-page application (SPA) design. Each approach offers distinct advantages: Express HTML was foundational for rendering server-side views, allowing for fast initial loads, while JavaScript provided dynamic client-side interactions, making the UI more responsive. The SPA approach, on the other hand, streamlined the user experience by loading a single HTML page and updating content dynamically, which enhanced performance by reducing server requests. The backend utilized a NoSQL MongoDB database due to its flexibility in handling unstructured data, scalability, and ease of integration with JSON objects. This choice was particularly beneficial for managing complex and variable data structures in a dynamic application like this one.

Functionality
JSON plays a pivotal role in connecting the frontend and backend. While JavaScript is the language used for scripting on the frontend, JSON acts as a lightweight format for data interchange, seamlessly transmitting information between the client-side interface and the backend server. I refactored code several times throughout the project to enhance functionality, primarily by modularizing reusable UI components. This not only reduced redundancy but also made the codebase easier to maintain and scale, as common elements could be updated in one place and reflected across multiple views.

Testing
Testing a full stack application requires thorough examination of both API request and retrieval methods. Endpoints serve as gateways for client-server communication, and testing them is crucial to ensure they respond correctly to various requests while adhering to security protocols. Incorporating security into testing can be challenging, especially when dealing with layers like authentication and data encryption. By applying API testing methods such as unit tests, integration tests, and security tests, I ensured that the endpoints worked as intended while safeguarding sensitive user data.

Reflection
This course has significantly advanced my professional goals by deepening my understanding of full stack development. I gained hands-on experience with MongoDB, Express, and frontend technologies, as well as learned best practices for API testing and security. These skills are critical in making me a more competitive candidate in the field of software engineering, particularly for roles focused on developing scalable, efficient, and secure applications. Additionally, the ability to refactor code and develop reusable components has enhanced my ability to deliver maintainable solutions, which is highly valued in the industry.
